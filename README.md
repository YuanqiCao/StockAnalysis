# StockAnalysis

**Introduction: Basically an application lets the user hand select a few stocks that are interested by themself and input stocks into the program. The program will also ask the user for some personal information such as income or assets. The AnalysisCalculator will then calculate which stocks are best suited for the investor based on risk and reward balance.
